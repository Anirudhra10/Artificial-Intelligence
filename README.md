Project-1: Rule Based TicTacToe game that allows user to play against computer. Computer utilizes multiple strategies to make its next move.

Project-2: A Robotworld design where a hand picks up an object located in a x-y plane and moves it to the destination. Different search strategies such as DFS, BFS, A* and Best First are implemented (with Heuristics for the last two) to choose the shortest possible path (cost) and to expand the least number of nodes between source and destination.
